## Sergei Bortkiewicz, Mazurka Op.12 No.1

This score is based on the [score from user 'Mcroskell' on IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/3_Pieces,_Op.12_(Bortkiewicz,_Sergei)) which, unfortunately, has not the best scan quality.

Changes from the original include:
- Few pedal markings were included.
- No fingering.
- Different beaming in the "poco pi√π vivo" section to (in my opinion) better convey the rhythmic grouping.
- The middle section was turned into a segno repeat, as it repeats almost completely unchanged in the original score.  This reduces the number of pages from 5 to 3.

There are three versions of the score:
- `op12-01.ly` is the intended and layout-optimized version of the score.
- `op12-01-unfold.ly` is identical, but unfolds the repeats and is typeset on five pages.  Some expressive marks aren't quite right here; I might fix this in the future.
- `op12-01-changestaff.ly` is a version where I experimented with moving the treble chords of the left hand into the upper staff.  It's experimental.
